ChatGPT 4o:

You are an expert frontend developer in html and vanilla javascript. Create a web application that will have a centered title "Inversor de texto", with a form just below with a text input to the left with placeholder "Introduce un texto" and a blue button to the right with text "Invertir" And just below it a Label "Texto invertido: " that will have a concatenated text in green that will start being blank. Make it responsive.

This page will work inverting the text inputted with the button and setting it in the green text just below. Generate a single html file called index.html and a single javascript file called script.js

---

Use tailwind css framework for styling instead of creating a .css file

---

(Attach res/reverse string.png)
Update my html to make it look a little closer to this image. Also add a button to copy the reversed String value.

---

keep the input placeholder to "Introduce un texto". For the thumbnail icons in the buttons use an emoji of recycle for reverse and a copy emoji for copy.

---

now create an .md documentation about this application

---

can you add unit tests for my code?
